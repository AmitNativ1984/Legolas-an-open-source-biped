# Legolas - An Open Source Bipedal Robot

Legolas is a mini bipedal robot inspired by the Cassie by Agility Robotics. The project aims to provide an open-source platform for applying reinforcement learning in robotics.

## Technologies Used

- Solidworks for the physical design of the robot.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains CAD files and 3D printing files for Legolas. The code for the robot is available in a separate repository.

## Dependencies

Users will need to refer to the code repository for the software and electronics dependencies required to run Legolas.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Legolas.git
    ```

2. **Modify the CAD files:**

    Modify the CAD files to fit your specific needs using Solidworks.

3. **3D Print your own robot:**

    Alternatively, use the provided STL files in the `STL` folder to 3D print your own robot.

4. **Acquire required electronics:**

    Acquire the required electronics as specified in the code repository.

## Usage

Instructions and examples for using Legolas will be added in future updates.
